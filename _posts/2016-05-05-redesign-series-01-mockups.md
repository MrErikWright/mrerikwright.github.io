Perhaps one of the best parts of design is seeing a final mockup come to fruition. Continuing with where I left off in my last post, I'd like to share with you the final product.

If you've been following along thus far, you'll know that I've been working on an apartment leasing website redesign. If you haven't, allow me to recap. I worked on this site as a front-end developer, but never actually had any input on the design. Upon receiving the initial mockup (many months ago), I knew I wanted to try my hand at making it cleaner, more accessible, and more visually pleasing.

This is what I have come up with:

The first thing you'll probably notice is that I altered the Featured Properties and Locations sections. After some time away from the wireframes, I started getting ideas that seemed more logical and that fit better with the overall experience I was going for. The Featured Properties section took a cue from the already-existing search page. When I first designed the wireframes, this section was only going to focus on *one* property. I feel that this solution more elegantly highlights multiple properties.

The idea for the Locations section is simple. The user can hover over the location name, and the blue dot on the map will change color and offer a tooltip. It will also work in reverse (hover over a dot, tooltip pops up and location name is highlighted). I feel this will add subtle interactivity and will give a visual cue to where the properties are located.

I also wanted to showcase the mobile site's look and feel. Overall, I wanted the simplicity to shine through. Upon landing on the page, you're only greeted with a single search field. There's also a Call Us button that makes it extremely simple to get the information you need about a certain property. No more hunting for a phone number or filling out five fields for a basic search.

And, that's it. Stayed tuned for the second redesign of the series.
