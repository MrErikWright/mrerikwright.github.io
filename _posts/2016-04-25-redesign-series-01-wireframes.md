For the first part of the Redesign Series, I'll be looking at, and enhancing, an apartment leasing website. I worked on this site prior to leaving my job at The Cyphers Agency. I wasn't completely satisfied with the final outcome.

Perhaps a good place to start is with the current site. Below is what the site looks like at the time of writing this post.

Before I start talking about my revisions, let me first discuss the downfalls of this current iteration.

#### UI Components

* **Color scheme**. When the client approached us, Kay Apartments had one primary color: blue. This blue can be seen in the footer of the current site. About three-fourths of the way through building the site, the client wanted to add the green color to indicate "being environmentally conscious." Throwing caution to the wind, we accepted; however, I never truly got on board with the whole "green color equals a green initiative." It seemed haphazard to me.
* **Body background color / boxed layout**. It's 2016. While the boxed layout has its place, this is definitely not it. Looking at competitors and big-name sites (for example, Apartments.com), none use a boxed layout.
* **Gradient meshes**. When I first saw the black gradient meshes, I wasn't thrilled. To this day, I don't like them. They don't belong on the site. It just doesn't mesh well (no pun intended).
* **Carousel**. The green carousel doesn't really serve a purpose. It moves too slowly, which means that people aren't going to sit there and watch it. For me, it's unnecessary.
* **SEO**. One quick glance at the footer and you see the obvious SEO keywords thrown in there. See that? Just below the Find an Apartment section? Surely that information could have been placed in a less awkward position. Perhaps across the bottom of the footer, below the "Great locations at a great price" copy, or integrated in some way into the layout.

#### UX Components

* **Search functionality**. The most important aspect of the site is search. The sole reason for coming to this site is to find an apartment in your area. On the desktop version (pictured above), you have to click on the green "Find an Apartment" box. This opens up the search box (for the record, it's not readily apparent that you're supposed to click on the box). That's one too many clicks. As a user, if I'm coming to a site to search, I want the search box prominently displayed. I don't want to have to click unnecessarily. Couple that with a mind-blowing number of search parameters and you've got yourself a UX headache.
* **Main slider**. The main slider serves as a way to showcase various properties. The problem? You can't actually cycle through them anymore. When I first designed and developed the site, I included navigation arrows to cycle through the slides. Now, they've been disabled.

#### My Solution
Taking all of the above into account, I set out to create the wireframes for the updated site. I focused on making sure the UI was clean and the UX was logical. I addressed all the problems above and fixed &mdash; or tweaked &mdash; them to arrive at my solution.

In the next part of this series, I'll reveal the high-fidelity mockups for this redesign.
