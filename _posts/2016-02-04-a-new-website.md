If you think clients are tough, try creating your own portfolio. I've always found myself to be the harshest critic. Everything has to be just right. Luckily, I think I've managed to crack the code.

Today, I'm proud to announce that I'm launching my new site. It's still a work in progress, and will likely change over the course of the next few months, but I'm happy to finally have something up. It was a long time coming. I spent a while determining what platform I would use to host this site. I chose Jekyll and Github Pages.

I've never used Jekyll or Github pages, so it was a learning experience &mdash; a great one at that. Jekyll is a pleasure to work with. It sure beats having a database and a large overhead to worry about. Like Jekyll, Github Pages is great. Free hosting and versioning are two of my favorite features.

So please, have a look around. Check out the case studies. Be sure to come back often as I'll be updating the site constantly (I'm already thinking about version 2). I'm currently looking for work in Austin, TX, so if you have a job opportunity or know someone who's hiring, please reach out to me.
