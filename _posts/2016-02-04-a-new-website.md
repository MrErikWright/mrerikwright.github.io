If you think clients are tough, try creating your own portfolio. I've always found myself to be the harshest critic. I'll change my mind twenty times before committing to something. I suppose it comes with the territory. After all, your portfolio is an extension of yourself.

Today, I'm proud to announce that I've battled those demons. I've conquered the unending changes, and I'm releasing my new portfolio. My old portfolio paled in comparison to this. It was a simple single page portfolio hosted at a subdomain. It served its purpose (hey, it landed me a job), but I wanted to create something better. Something that is an extension of myself and can further solidify my brand.

This portfolio was an adventure. I decided to try my hand at some new technologies (for me, at least): Jekyll, Sass, and Git. Before this site, I had never used any of these. I know, I know. For shame. It's taken far too long to get acclimated to these, but I have to say that I love them so far.

I've been working with WordPress sites for the past year, and I knew I didn't want to use it for my portfolio site. While it serves a purpose, I didn't want to deal with it. Between security vulnerabilities, constant updates, and using a database, I wanted something simpler. That's where Jekyll comes in. Sure, I had never used the terminal before, but how hard could it be? It turns out, not difficult at all. In fact, it was pretty painless. As of right now, Jekyll is one of my favorite platforms for building sites.

Sass was also completely new to me. I've read about CSS preprocessors for a while now, but never used them. In my previous job, we just used vanilla CSS. In hindsight, I should have pushed for the adoption of either Less or Sass. After using it once, I don't think I could ever go back to writing regular CSS. The versatility is phenomenal.

And finally, Git. Another amazing tool that I didn't use at my last job. Again, like Sass, it's something I should have pushed for. One of the final projects I worked on at my last job could have benefited from Git. I was working with a database developer on a site. He handled the backend while I took care of the front-end. The first half of the project was seamless. He did what he needed to do and we didn't disrupt each other. The second half of the project was rough. We had to keep telling each other to download the newest files because of changes. I would make a change one day, and he'd go in, download the file, and make his changes. Then, I would come back and download his file. It was a pain. He had asked if we implemented any versioning on our projects. Unfortunately, I had to say no. We *should* have had versioning software, especially when working with freelancers.

So, here we are. A brand new site. It lives on Github, so it should force me to keep it updated and fresh with new content. Here's to hoping that this keeps me on track. I look forward to learning and discovering new skills, and sharing them.
