"You're only as good as your last project."

In an effort to improve, hone, and develop my visual style, I'm going to tackle website redesigns.

<!--more-->

Let's face it. Not all sites are created equal, and sometimes you're just not happy with the outcome. Whether that's due to a direction you took or the client wanted something specific, websites don't always turn out for the best. What does this ultimately mean? I won't be redesigning just any site. I'll choose sites for one of the following reasons:

* The site is outdated and could use a visual pick-me-up or an experience overhaul
* I previously worked on the site and wasn't happy with the direction it took (either due to the client or time constraints)
* I coded the site, but never got the chance to work with the design team
* I feel like it

This particular blog series will continue until I'm ready to take a break. I will share sketches, wireframes, design decisions, high-fidelity mockups, and more as I document my journey of learning and exploration. There's no better way to learn and grow than to dive in and keep creating.

I've already started working on the first redesign in this series. The site was one that I had the opportunity to code, but not design. The design was completed by the creative director and approved by the client before anyone saw it. Personally, I feel as though the site could have been better had there been some collaboration. Overall, the site fell a little short for me, so I decided to make it the first redesign in the series.

Stay tuned for updates.
