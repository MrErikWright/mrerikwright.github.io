I'm incredibly excited to launch my new portfolio! This newest version has been fine-tuned and completely rewritten from the ground up. Although much of the content remains largely unchanged (for now), the underlying structure has seen a significant overhaul. This is due, in large part, to the knowledge I've gained over the past year.

I'm excited to finally push this live. As my good friend [Hector](https://github.com/punchyguy) says, "Your portfolio is like Sasquatch. You know it exists, but no one has seen it." I suppose that's not the case anymore. Finally getting this out there serves two purposes: it helps highlight what I've learned and it forces me to channel my inner thoughts, opinions, and solutions. The keyword here being **solutions.**

In an effort to give back to the community, I plan to offer solutions to coding problems I'm having (or had) in the off chance that it can help someone else. I have found that what might be an *obvious, easy solution* to one person, might not be that way for someone else. Documenting solutions &mdash; even if it's not an exact solution for someone else &mdash; helps other programmers solve their own problems.

I'll also be documenting my journey through learning new languages and techniques. I have a list of languages I'd like to learn; it's just a matter of buckling down and learning them. First up will be ES6 (JavaScript).

Hopefully these random musings and tidbits will provide some helpful insight. I'm looking forward to growing as a developer, gaining new knowledge along the way, and hopefully imparting some wisdom for my readers.
