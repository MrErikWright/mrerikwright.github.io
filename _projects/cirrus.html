title: Cirrus Valuation
overview: "A custom design for Cirrus Valuation, an independent business valuation firm. This company is a one-man operation; however, companies tend to disregard smaller valuation firms because they feel they lack the manpower to get the job done. The end goal was to bring a corporate look and feel to an independent business. Unfortunately, this design never made it to development."

<h2 class="u-text-bold">The Challenge</h2>
<p>We've all been to that one site that looks like it could use a fresh coat of paint. You know that one I'm talking about, right? For businesses, a website needs a facelift every couple of years. This particular site was long overdue. The logo typeface, color scheme, and excessive use of gradients were all indications that a revision needed to happen. As a longtime client, I was confident that, if he took this journey with us, he would not be disappointed.</p>

<h2 class="u-text-bold">The Solution</h2>

<h6><strong>Logo</strong></h6>

<p>The first aspect of his site to be updated was the logo. It was in dire need of attention. Utilizing an over-the-top script font and a stark gradient, the logo didn't quite capture his business' core offerings. After several discussions, I was not able to persuade him to give up the script font. He did settle on a bolder, more robust script font that commands attention. The gradient was swapped out for a solid color. Finally, the subheading transitioned from a serif to a sans serif to further update the look and feel.</p>

<h6><strong>Website</strong></h6>

<p>If I thought the logo was difficult to nail down, boy, was I in for a surprise when I started work on the website refresh. The client came to the table with several visions for what he wanted. His main concern was making sure that he looked like a corporate business, while still maintaining his one-man company charm. We accomplished this by featuring his personal credentials at the forefront of the design. With a single scroll, you would know his certifications and could easily contact him with questions or inquiries.</p>

<h2 class="u-text-bold">The Final Outcome</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, this design never made it to production. After several iterations, the client decided to hold off until further notice.</p>
