<h2 class="u-text-bold">How It Started</h2>

<p>Kay Apartments' old website was built with Flash. Cue any negative connotations associated with that. All updates to the site had to be done twice &mdash; once for mobile and once for desktop &mdash; and compiled before uploading to their web host. This is not exactly the streamlined process that it could be. Ultimately, the site was redesigned and developed; however, shortly after seeing the design, I knew that I wanted to tackle this project and see if I could improve it even more.</p>

<h2 class="u-text-bold">Weaknesses</h2>

<p>Before I discuss my revisions, let me begin by highlighting the shortcomings that I believe are present in the current (live) design.</p>

<h6 class="u-text-bold">UI Components</h6>

<ul class="default-ul">
	<li>Color scheme</li>
	<li>Body background color / boxed layout</li>
	<li>Gradient meshes</li>
	<li>Carousel</li>
	<li>SEO</li>
</ul>

<h6 class="u-text-bold">UX Components</h6>

<ul class="default-ul">
	<li>Search functionality</li>
	<li>Main slider</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="u-text-bold">The Wireframes</h2>

<p>As I worked through the homepage design, I focused on &mdash; what I felt were &mdash; the three most important aspects of this site: search, user interface, and user experience. Based on my research of competitors, search is the most integral part of apartment hunting. Having this front and center is important. I simplified the search by removing extraneous criteria, which makes it quicker for apartment hunters to find exactly what they're looking for.</p>

<h2 class="u-text-bold">The Mockups</h2>

<p>The first thing you'll likely notice is that the wireframe and high fidelity mockup are slightly different. As with any project, iteration is key. The Featured Properties mimics the Search page; the focus is on multiple properties, rather than a single property. The Locations section is built to provide some interactivity to the page. The idea is that users have the ability to hover over a location name and a tooltip will appear on the map, highlighting the location.</p>
