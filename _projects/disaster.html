<h2 class="u-text-bold">The Challenge</h2>

<p>Disaster Housing Services is unique. Their old website was composed of tables, broken links, a drab color palette, and a logo that didn't articulate their offerings. To help them carve out a space for their business, I focused on two things: a new logo and a redesigned website.</p>

<h2 class="u-text-bold">The Solution</h2>

<h6><strong>Logo</strong></h6>

<p>The old logo was confusing. It had danger signs, exclamation points, a house, and three colors. The first thing I focused on was the symbolism behind their previous choices. Once I narrowed it down to a few core ideas, I began sketching ideas for the new logo. The client ended up selecting what is seen below: a smiling house sitting atop their word mark. The type &mdash; in this case &mdash; acts as a sturdy foundation for the house, while the house embodies what they provide for people.</p>

<h6><strong>Website</strong></h6>

<p>After completing the logo, I moved on to the website. The goal was accessibility. People would come to this site after a disaster and would need to find information quickly and efficiently. Prior to this redesign, they had forms scattered across multiple pages. The forms were consolidated down to just three.</p>
