Focusing on the fusion of design and code, Erik Wright is a self-taught visual designer and front-end developer.

He holds a BS with distinction in Computer Graphics Technology and a minor in Computer Information Technology from Purdue University. His focus was 3D character animation. After college, he attended several online schools to continue learning animation. As time passed, though, he became interested in building websites. With no formal education, he set out to please his insatiable appetite for design and code. Two years and two jobs later, Erik has worked with many businesses to help bring their vision to life.

Erik spends his days creating for the web and his evenings [bringing characters to life](https://vimeo.com/90569070). He enjoys music, British football (Liverpool), cooking, writing, typography, traveling, and cars. He also has an unhealthy obsession with the Oxford comma and the em dash.

Erik currently resides in Texas and is available for work.
