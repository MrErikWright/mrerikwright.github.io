title: Disaster Housing Services
overview: "Like something out of the '80s, Disaster Housing Services needed a complete rebrand. They needed a new logo and a new website to push themselves above the competition. The logo illustrates their main focus: finding homes for people in crisis. The responsive website strives to create a friendly user interface for the greatest ease-of-use."

### The Challenge
When Disaster Housing Services came to us, they needed a complete rebrand. Their website still used tables, half of their links didn't work, and the color palette was drab. Not a good start for them. I had two challenges with this rebrand. First, I needed to tackle their logo. This would help set the tone for their website. Second, I needed to design a clean and modern responsive website.

### The Solution: Logo
Their old logo had danger signs, exclamation points, a house, and three colors. I kept their color palette, but consolidated the logo into a single icon and their company name. When designing their logo, I focused on what they were about. The house icon illustrates that they provide nice housing for people displaced by disasters. I treated the type as if it were the foundation to the house. I wanted their logo to embody what they stood for.

### The Solution: Website
The website's focus was clear: make it responsive and easy to navigate. People would be coming to this site after an emergency looking for a temporary house. They had quite a few forms on their old site, which I consolidated down to three to make it less daunting. The design took a clean, minimal approach. I wanted the images to be the main focal point of the site.
