### The Challenge
Flexible Packaging Association came to us with a vision. They have been the voice of the packaging industry for fifty years. As such, they wanted to leverage this by having resources available to prospective employees. That's where we came in. With over 150 members, they wanted a way to showcase these companies and their offerings. More so, they needed a way to highlight available jobs. They contacted us asking for a microsite that would benefit members and prospects alike. My challenge was to create an inviting and functional website.

### The Solution
Unlike other websites I've built, this one was straightforward. With a total of three pages, this site was small. The homepage acted as an introduction for Flexible Packaging Association. Anyone without prior knowledge of them could learn about who they are and what they do. The careers page was the most important. It included a map that allowed prospective employees to search for companies near them. A list of companies was also included with links to their respective careers page.

The development for this site took about 20 hours. I built the site using WordPress so the client could update content in the future.
