### The Challenge
Having a website is important, especially if you're a business looking to grow. And that's exactly the case with Signature Collision Centers. Before contacting us, they had no online presence. They relied on word-of-mouth recommendations. While this worked for them in the past, they noticed a downward trend in new clients. Prospects were questioning their authenticity. That's where we came in. My challenge was to build them a modern, functional, and authentic site.

### The Solution: Logo
At the time of refreshing their logo, they had eight locations. This meant that we couldn't change their logo a great deal. The previous logo's typeface looked like something off of an old car. The letters were strung together by a solid line near the baseline. I ended up swapping out this font. The end result still has a similar look and feel.

### The Solution: Website
After the logo update, I moved on to the website. Going into this, I wanted to focus on creating a clean, professional, and usable site. They had two must haves: a map highlighting locations and a job board. The map served two purposes. For one, it would allow clients to find the closest body shop to them. It would also show how much they're growing. I ended up implementing a solution that makes adding new locations simple and straightforward. The job board was a little trickier. I had to make sure it had all the functionality they needed with a easy-to-use interface. After going through several options, they settled on one that has served them well.
