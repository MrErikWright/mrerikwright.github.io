### The Challenge
We've all been to that site. You know, the one that looks dated, out-of-touch, and no longer pleasing to the eye. The old site looks like something designed back in 2005. And that's a problem. As a returning client, I felt confident I could help Cirrus Valuation regain its former glory. My challenge was to update the logo and redesign the web experience.

### The Solution
I started out by focusing my attention on the logo. The old logo was in dire need of a rebrand. It used an almost whimsical script font that was too over-the-top. After all, this is the business valuation field we're talking about.

Unfortunately, I couldn't convince him to give up the script font completely. I ended up swapping out the whimsical font for a bolder, more robust script font. I removed the gradient color from the logo and replaced it with a solid green. The subheading went from a serif to a sans-serif to further update the look and feel.

The website was a little tougher to nail down. The client had a specific vision of what he wanted. It was my job to collect his ideas and turn them into a pleasing design. Perhaps the most prominent idea was the portrayal of this site. He's a one-man company, but caters to many large businesses. Many companies don't like hiring just one individual. They prefer large companies that have many employees. This means that he's in a unique situation. The website had to focus on appearing large, but still showcasing his situation. The final design placed his credentials at the forefront of everything else.

### The Final Outcome
Unfortunately, this design never made it to development. After several iterations, the client dropped off. I looked forward to coding this site; it had a certain element of cohesion to it. It was clean, modern, and I had some interaction and animation ideas to make this pop.
