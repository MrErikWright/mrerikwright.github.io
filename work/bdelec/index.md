### The Challenge
Getting your website hacked is never a pleasant experience. This is exactly what happened to Bausum &amp; Duckett Electric. Not long after, they reached out to us. Within hours, I was salvaging any file I could. It wasn't a particularly successful venture, but I managed to collect some copy. This proved to be useful with the new site. However, with good news comes bad news. Most of their images were unusable. They were small thumbnail-sized photos. This meant that we would need to integrate stock photos with their personal photos.

### The Solution
First order of business: create a simple landing page. Since their site got hacked, they needed some sort of page describing who they were and what they did. I created a landing page with a prominent contact form. This ensured that they wouldn't miss out on any potential clients. The landing page launched and served its purpose.

Once completed, I shifted gears to their new website. Bausum &amp; Duckett is a small, local company. They have a hearty mixture of commercial and residential projects. The focus with this new site was to highlight their versatility.

Since they have a lot of existing collateral, their logo and color palette remained unchanged. These elements carried over to their new website. I focused on marrying a corporate look with a personable touch. The site is completely responsive and aims to provide ample project samples.
