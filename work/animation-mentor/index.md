title: Animation Mentor
overview: "An iOS app design for Animation Mentor, the online animation school. I completed their program and always wished they had better mobile support. Having the ability to communicate with other animators, view their work, and give and receive feedback is important, which is the core of this app. This is an unsolicited design."
