### The Backstory
Toward the end of my stint at The Cyphers Agency, the owner of Kay Apartments approached us asking for a revamp of his corporate site. At the time, his site was built in Flash. This meant that every update had to be done twice (desktop and mobile). Immediately, we knew that a responsive site with search functionality was the way to go. The creative director handled the design, while I handled the development. I had no design input on this particular project; it was completed and approved by the client before I saw it for the first time. However, after viewing the design, I knew I wanted to redesign it.

### The Shortcomings
Before I begin talking about my revisions, let me highlight the shortcomings that I feel are present in the current iteration of the site.

##### UI Components
* Color scheme
* Body background color / boxed layout
* Gradient meshes
* Carousel
* SEO

##### UX Components
* Search functionality
* Main slider

### The Wireframes
When tackling this redesign, I wanted to focus on three things: the search, the user interface, and the user experience. With the current iteration of Kay Apartments, the search is hidden. This doesn't make for a great user experience. You'll notice in my redesign that the search is simplified, easily accessible, and contains less fields.

### The Mockups
Perhaps the first thing you'll notice is that the wireframe and mockup are slightly different. After creating the wireframe and stepping away, I began getting more ideas for the Featured Properties and Locations sections. The Featured Properties section took a cue from the already-existing Search page. Highlighting multiple properties allows users to see several locations, rather than focusing on one individual property. The Locations section adds some interactivity to the page. Users are able to hover over the location name or dot, and a tooltip will appear. This subtle interactivity will give a visual cue as to where the properties are located.
