### The Challenge
The American Boat &amp; Yacht Council came to us for a refresh of an existing brand. They were also interested in creating a new microsite. The microsite would offer pertinent information for recreational boaters. Standards, finding a certified technician, and do-it-yourself videos were all important. They needed the site to be accessible on many devices. My challenge was to create a web experience that was inviting and functional.

### The Solution
Starting out with wireframes, I focused on functionality first. I wanted to ensure that it took less than three clicks to get anywhere on the site. I also wanted to ensure that no one missed the Find a Technician section. During the brief, ABYC let me know that this was the most important section. As a result, I decided to include it in the main navigation and below the slider.

After wireframes, I moved onto the design. The header and footer carried over from their corporate site. This cohesion was important. During the design, I focused on form and function, as opposed to one or the other. I wanted to make it inviting, but also practical to use.

Once the design got approved, I switched gears to development. I knew the responsive nature had to be spot on with this site. Since I didn't have metrics, I couldn't take any chances. ABYC emphasized that people would be coming to this site from different devices. They couldn't stress this enough. I spent a bit of time focusing on making this site look good at many different breakpoints.
