<h2 class="u-text-bold">The Challenge</h2>

<p>Typically, when work begins on a new website, designs are created, images are gathered, development is iterative, and the final product is a harmonious conglomeration of visuals and code. The keyword here is typical.</p>

<p>This job was anything but typical.</p>

<p>When I was approached by Bausum &amp; Duckett, they explained that their site had been hacked. As you can probably guess, that's not a great way to start a project. Perhaps more daunting, was their lack of quality photographs. Developing a site without expressive and interesting photography is difficult to do. Sure, placeholders will work to lay out the page, but to succinctly tie together text and imagery? Just a tad bit more difficult. Despite these minor setbacks, I got right to work.</p>

<h2 class="u-text-bold">The Solution</h2>

<h6><strong>Landing Page</strong></h6>

<p>Unless you've been living under a rock, you know that online business is a massive industry. Not having a website for a business is similar to not having a sign on a brick and mortar store. You'd never do that, right? With this mindset, I set out to create a simple landing page. This page contained just the right amount of information &mdash; name, phone number, contact form, and a short description of the business &mdash; for prospective customers to get ahold of the company. While I finished this up, the Creative Director began working on the website's look and feel.</p>

<h6><strong>Permanent Website</strong></h6>

<p>Upon launching the landing page, my focus shifted to developing a custom WordPress theme for their permanent website. The Creative Director had designed the navigation bar and the hero slider before handing it off to me to complete. I finished designing the rest of the landing page, as well as two additional subpages. This ensured that the client could get a feel for the creative direction we were taking. After I received the client's feedback, I incorporated their changes and worked on building the site of their dreams.</p>
