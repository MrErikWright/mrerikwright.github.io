<h2 class="u-text-bold">The Challenge</h2>

<p>With over fifty years of experience, Flexible Packaging Association had a vision. They wanted to build a space that was not only accessible to prospective employees, but also highlight their 150 members. Providing available job opportunities was an easy task; highlighting companies and their unique offerings was more challenging.</p>

<h2 class="u-text-bold">The Solution</h2>

<p>This website has a total of three pages: a homepage, careers page, and a members list. The homepage is an introduction to Flexible Packaging Association. Not sure who they are or what they do? This will outline their history and their offerings. Once information is gathered about the company, the next logical progression is to check for available opportunities. The careers page is unique in that it uses Bullseye Locations, a store locator, to highlight members that are hiring. A typical job board was quickly dismissed as a viable option by the client because they felt it wasn't interactive enough. The store locator, on the other hand, did the trick.</p>

<p>The total development time for this site came in at 20 hours. WordPress was chosen for its ease of editing; the client could make changes to their members list without needing a developer.</p>
