<h2 class="u-text-bold">The Challenge</h2>

<p>In today's day and age, having an online presence is monumental to the success of a business, especially if they're looking to expand. When Signature Collision Centers approached me, they didn't have a website. They focused their attention on word-of-mouth recommendations. While this works, to an extent, they wanted to continue expanding. Couple that with a downward trend in new clients and they knew they needed a change.</p>

<h2 class="u-text-bold">The Solution</h2>

<h6><strong>Logo</strong></h6>

<p>One of the first tasks was to refresh their logo. At the time of the redesign, they had eight locations &mdash; all with custom signage. This meant that any tweaks to the logo couldn't be drastic. The biggest change came through a typeface swap. Their old typeface was like something off of an old Cadillac. While it had served them well for many years, they wanted to update the typeface to something more modern.</p>

<h6><strong>Website</strong></h6>

<p>Once the logo was solidified, it was time to move onto the website. The focus was on creating a professional and usable site. There were two requirements: a map highlighting their physical locations and a job board (to further facilitate their growth). A map would provide an easy way for customers to find the closest body shop to them. The job board was trickier to get right. The client had an idea for what they wanted, so finding the correct solution was important.</p>
